            When I walk on by, girls be looking like damn he fly
            I pimp to the beat, walking down the street in my new lafreak, yeah
            This is how I roll, animal print, pants out control,
            It's RedFoo with the big afro
            And like Bruce Lee I've got the claw

            Girl look at that body (x3)
            I work out
            Girl look at that body (x3)
            I work out

            When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
            Everybody stops and they staring at me
            I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it

            I'm sexy and I know it (x2)

            When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight 'em off
            When I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
            This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
            We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
            No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service

            Girl look at that body (x3)
            I work out

            I let it fall, my heart
            And as it fell, you rose to claim it
            It was dark and I was over
            Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
            My hands, they were strong, but my knees were far too weak
            To stand in your arms without falling to your feet

            But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
            All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
            And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win

            But I set fire to the rain
            Watched it pour as I touched your face
            Well, it burned while I cried
            'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

            When laying with you I could stay there
            Close my eyes, feel you here forever
            You and me together, nothing is better

            'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
            All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
            And the games you's play, you would always win, always win
