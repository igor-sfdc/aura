    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Adapters"/>

    <p>Aura has a set of adapters that provide default implementations of functionality that you can override. For example, the localization adapter provides the default behavior for working with labels and locales. You may want to override this behavior for your own localization requirements.</p>
    
    <p>Think of an adapter as a plugin point for your custom code. It's useful to contrast this with the Aura Integration Service, which enables you to inject Aura components into a Web app that is not developed in Aura.</p>
    
    <p><code>AuraAdapter</code> is the base marker interface for all adapters. You can find all the adapter interfaces in the <code>org.auraframework.adapter</code> package.</p>
