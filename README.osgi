This fork of Aura repo contains changes required to build and run Aura framework in OSGi mode
with ability to extend it by providing application artifacts in a separate bundle (e.g., Aura-note)

The code is very preliminary, has not been fully tested and can be considered a POC only.



Steps to build and run Aura as an OSGi bundle:

1.  Install Maven version 3.0.5 (http://apache.mirrors.pair.com/maven/maven-3/3.0.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.5-bin.tar.gz).
The latest Maven version 3.1.0 has problems with one of the plugins being used here

2. Clone this repo locally then build and run Aura from command line:

    mkdir -p <path-to-local-repo>
    cd <path-to-local-repo>
    git clone https://github.com/igor-sfdc/aura
    cd <path-to-local-repo>/aura
    mvn install -DskipUnitTests -DstartLauncher -DstartBrowser -DhttpPort=9090

Your default browser should automatically open Auradocs application. If
it does not then try manually navigating to: 

    http://localhost:9090/auradocs/docs.app#

3. Optionally, to include a separate Aura-note application bundle and run it alongside Aura framework replace #2 with:

    mkdir -p <path-to-local-repo>
    cd <path-to-local-repo>
    git clone https://github.com/igor-sfdc/aura
    cd <path-to-local-repo>/aura
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    mvn install -DskipUnitTests
    mvn install -f aura-note/pom.xml
    mvn install -pl osgi-launcher -DstartLauncher -DstartBrowser -DhttpPort=9090

After your default browser opens Auradocs page navigate to Aura-note:

    http://localhost:9090/auranote/notes.app#



To use this with Eclipse:

1. Install Bndtools and m2e into your Eclipse IDE. 


2. Create an empty Eclipse workspace in a folder
different from <path-to-local-repo>/aura

3. Import the existing cnf project as Import->General->Existing 
Projects into the Workspace. Do not check "copy" checkbox

4. Import the remaining Maven projects into Eclipse as 
Import->Maven->Existing Maven Projects

5. Now you should be able to right-click on Launcher class 
and Run it As Java, which should start Aura in OSGi mode. If you get
any errors run manual build steps again.


Future steps planned:

1. More rigorous testing and bug fixes
